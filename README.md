# AncientVision-3T
AncientVision-3T is a hierarchical benchmark designed to systematically evaluate vision–language models (VLMs) on ancient Chinese document image–text tasks. It targets the unique challenges of low-resource and cross-temporal scenarios, where models must jointly handle severe visual degradation, complex layouts, and historically grounded semantics.
